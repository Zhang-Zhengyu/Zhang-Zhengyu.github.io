# Chapter 1

## Opportunities/ challenges
1. traditional data-oriented scientific and engineerig fields.
2. non-traditional data engineering damians such as **social science, business** and **management**.
3. statistics and mathematics, artificial intelligences, etc

* Yet, they have never been adequatedlu addressed in classic methodelogies, theories, systems, tools, applications and economy
* data science - very erarly stage
* Issue and possibilities unique to dta science and big data analytics are **not clear**, **not specific**, **not certain**

**Fourth science paradigm**  --data-intensive scitenfic discovery 数据密集型的科学发现

## 3 V's of big data
1. **Volumn** the *amount* of data being generated and stored. 'smart phone' 'sensors in IoT' 'environment,location and etc.'
2. **Velocity** the *speed* at which data is being generated and processing.
3. **Variety**  the *different types* of data being generated and stored. 'numbers/ dates/ strings/ geospatial data/ 3D data/ aduio/ video/ unstructured text (log file/ social media)
4. **more V's** Veracity (accuracy of data), Value (how much worth can get)

## Data science/ Big data/ Data analysis
1.  **Data science** : "science of data"    
a multidisciplinary field that combines aspect of statistics, computer science, and domain knowledges to extract insights and knowledges from data.
2. **Big Data** data that are *too large* / *complex* to be *effectively*/  *efficiently handled by *traditional* data-related theories, technologies and tools.
3. **Data Analysis** "traditional way"  
The process of ectracting meaningful information from data using various tools and techniques. 


## Data Science related concept
1. **Data Analystics**
    1. refes to *theories, technologies, tools and processes* that enable an *in-depth understanding* into data and *discovery* of actionable insight *(decision making)*
    2. **methods** 
    - descriptive analytics 描述性分析--'what has happened?'
    exam past data to understand what has happened?
    - predictive analytics 预测性分析--'what would happen?'
    use historical data and trends to make predictions about future events
    - prescriptive analytics 规范性，指导性分析--'what should we do?'
    recommend actions to take based on the analysis of data


2. **Advanced analytics** (distinguished from data analysis/ a subset子集 of data analytics)
* employs more complex techniques such as machine learning, predictive modeling, and AI to make predictions and improve decision-making for businesses. 解决**传统分析方法**解决不了的**大数据**问题

3. **Deep Analytics** （Big Data Analytics）
* use **advanced analytical techniques** on **large** and **complex** dataset. 
* 解决descriptive analytics不能解决的问题
* enquire an **in-depth underatanding** of why and how things have happened, are happening, or will happen. 

3. **Key feature** 关键特征
- **Physical existence** - Datafication is ubiquitous, and data quantification is ever-increasing
- **Complexities** - Data complexities cannot be handled by classic theories and systems
- **Strategic values** 战略价值
    - Data becomes a strategic asset
    - Openness becomes a new paradigm and fashion
- **Research and development** - Data science research and innovation drive a new scientific 
agenda

4. **Trends** 发展趋势
- Start-up business
    - Data-driven strategic data initiatives and start-ups start to dominate new business
- Job market
    - Data scientist becomes a new profession
- Business and economy
    - Data drives both the new data economy and traditional industry transformation
    - Google (Alphabet), Facebook (Meta), Amazon
    - New products, systems and services in social media, mobile apps, online business, and IoT

- Disciplinary maturity
    - Data science becomes a new discipline, and data science is interdisciplinary (integrating knowledge and methods from different disciplines, using a real synthesis of approaches.)

**Relationship between five key concept**
- Data, information, knowledge, intelligence, wisdom

# Chapter 2
## Information Science & Data Science
- Information science   
Interdisciplinary(跨学科的) field that is concerned with 
information access, collection, storage, retrieval, 
processing, analysis, protection, presentation and 
publishing.
- 3 major sub-areas directly relevant to data science    
    1. Analysis and Processing (AP)
    Classic AP mainly relies on mathematical and statistical concepts, methods and tools
    e.g. tensor, regression, clustering, etc.
    * Information analysis and processing -> a new generation, containing typical subareas such as data mining, data analytics, and ML. (intelligence science)
    2. Informaics 
    - concerns the transformation of information into knowledge 信息 -> 知识
    3. ICT( information and communications technology) including software engineering, informaion systems and networking for data science.  
- Analysis and Processing have evolved and have expanded 
to new areas:
    1. Computational intelligence (CI), pattern recognition, data mining, machine learning, computer vision, and various data analytics (multimedia analytics)
    2. Engine of today's data science/ key stone of ICT:    
    Recognition, mining, analytics and learning

## Computing for data science 
**Relevent computing capabilities** 相关应用：
Infrastructure, algorithm design, data structure, computational complexity, programming (with R or Python), data management, enterprise application 
development, etc.

- R: for data analysis, developing statistical software
