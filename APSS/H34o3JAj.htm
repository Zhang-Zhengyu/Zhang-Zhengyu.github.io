</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The definition of service leadership</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Service leadership is a leadership style
that emphasizes serving others first before self-interest (Chung, 2011). It
involves building strong relationships, fostering teamwork, and empowering
others to achieve their full potential. Service leaders are focused on creating
value for their stakeholders, including customers, employees, and the community
(Chung, 2011). They lead by example, exhibit empathy, and are committed to
continuous improvement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In this service learning, the beneficiary
is not only the recipient of the service, but also the provider of the service
(Furco, 1996). Service learning enhances learning on topics related to a
specific learning domain through hands-on experience.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moral Character</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:49.6pt;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>Morality has great significance in promoting positive character
traits and fostering responsible behavior (Berkowitz, 2002). Good personal
ethics can promote pro-social behavior. Service leaders guide people to provide
services in accordance with social norms and ethical codes. From my
perspective, only when a person has good moral standards can he serve others and
himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:49.6pt'><span lang=EN-US>Service needs
professional skills or other ability that can be served to the recipient. For
example, I am an engineering student, and have competencies including,
programming language, software design, and database management. So, I can teach
primary school students some basic concept of the new technology, such as AI
and computers. </span></p>

integrate personal experience and academic discipline in service leadership.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Engineering students have a unique
opportunity to integrate their academic discipline to prepare themselves to be
service leaders. I can leverage my technical knowledge and skills to create
innovative solutions that address real-world problems and improve the quality of
life for others. Engineering students can apply design thinking,
problem-solving, and project management skills to create value for their
stakeholders.</span></p>
